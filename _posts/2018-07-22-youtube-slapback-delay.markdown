_Slapback Delay on YouTube._
{: .text-center .text-muted}

Hi, welcome to an episode of “Thinking Inside the Box” on Noah’s Ark. In the video, we're gonna talk about how to recreate a slapback delay effect as heard on many rockabilly records from the 50s.

The effect was popularised by artists such as Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash and the inventor of this effect is often attributed to Sun Records owner and producer Sam Phillips who helped propel Presley's career. Slapback echo is so defining as an effect that most people directly associate it with rock 'n' roll, country, blues and R&B music of the 50s.

There are many different types of delay and we'll discuss these in another video in more detail but basically it all comes down to delay time and the number of feedbacks. So slapback is usually a relatively short delay time with no feedback (one repeat) and the level of the delayed signal is very prominent in the mix, almost at the same level as the original source.

To find out more about the slapback delay effect, you can watch the video above or on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/iGHV6CNUFlM).
