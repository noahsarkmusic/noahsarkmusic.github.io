_Jimmy Page's Bow Guitar on YouTube._
{: .text-center .text-muted}

Hi, welcome to an episode of “Thinking Outside the Box” on Noah’s Ark. In the video, we're gonna talk about how to recreate Jimmy Page's bow guitar sound.

Jimmy Page is famous for having pioneered this guitar playing technique that consists in using a violin or cello bow to strike the strings on an electric guitar. It can be famously heard on Whole Lotta Love from the second Led Zeppelin album or seen playing a bow in many live performances including at the Royal Albert Hall in the Song Remains the Same.

Page also uses a lot of effects on the sound produced by the bow because the dry sound can be quite harsh when heard alone. On top of the distortion from the amp, Page used an Echoplex tape delay to create these lush and repeating echoes to the bow strikes.

The bow guitar sound can also be used effectively to create tense and disturbing atmospheres as a sound effect due to the harsh squeaking sound when electric guitar strings are bowed.

To find out more about Jimmy Page's bow guitar sound, you can watch the video above or on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/KBmpKTl97A0).
