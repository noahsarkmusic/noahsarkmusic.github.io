_Keith Richards' Distorted Acoustic Guitar on YouTube._
{: .text-center .text-muted}

Hi, welcome to an episode of “Thinking Inside the Box” on Noah’s Ark. In the video, we'll talk about Keith Richards’ guitar recording technique that I would like to name the “cassette guitar sound”. Richards is known to have used this technique on a couple of songs namely “Street Fighting Man”, “Jumpin’ Jack Flash” and “Gimme Shelter”.

This technique consists of recording multiple takes of an acoustic guitar onto a cheap cassette recorder over and over while overloading the input to create a distorted sound that resemble one of an electric guitar.

On top of this, he would re-record the output of these layered acoustic guitars through a speaker in the studio to thicken the sound even more. The result is a sound of distortion that is characteristic to this acoustic method and that is hard to emulate with traditional distortion pedals on an electric guitar.

To find out more about Keith Richards' distorted acoustic guitar sound, you can watch the video above or on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/ZTZNPedodo0).
