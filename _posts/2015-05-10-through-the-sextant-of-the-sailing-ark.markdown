Now is a good time to reflect on the current position of this journey. The Ark lifted its anchor about three months ago and here I am, still navigating through the troubled waves of the sea.

Although the reception of the first set of demos amongst friends was quite uplifting, the conquest of the outer public remains a mystery. The present situation can be perfectly summed up in the following survival scenario.

It is as though you are about to depart on a long journey and close friends wish you a safe and merry adventure. But soon enough you are forgotten by them as their routines swallow the nostalgia of your presence, and there you are, stranded on your boat in the middle of the ocean.

No doubts you are making good progress, extraordinary discoveries, learning from life-threatening dangers of the nature, and managing to survive on your limited fishing supplies. As time goes by, you accumulate treasures and become convinced that the wealth of what you have can turn the world upside down.

You have the key to your inner-passion’s lock, but you are missing a piece to the puzzle of life. You know how to use your sextant, you know where you are, but you struggle to emit your coordinates. Tens of thousands of ships are broadcasting radio signals that interfere.

In the final desperate whisper, you declare: “To all our listeners, this is what I have to say - God bless you all. And as for you bastards in charge, don't dream it's over. Years will come, years will go, and politicians will do fuck all to make the world a better place. But all over the world, young men and young women will always dream dreams and put those dreams into song. Nothing important dies tonight, just a few ugly guys on a crappy ship. The only sadness tonight is that, in future years, there'll be so many fantastic songs that it will not be our privilege to play. But, believe you me, they will still be written, they will still be sung and they will be the wonder of the world.”[^1]

All storms must come to an end.
