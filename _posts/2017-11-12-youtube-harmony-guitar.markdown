_Harmony Guitar on YouTube._
{: .text-center .text-muted}

Hi, welcome to a new series focusing on harmony, arranging and songwriting techniques called “Striking a Chord” on Noah’s Ark. In the video, we’re gonna start by discussing the layering of guitar melodies in a harmonic way, a technique widely-used since it’s inception half a century ago.

Layering different notes and stacking them up to form a certain chord is very common on vocals and polyphonic acoustic instruments such as guitars and pianos do it naturally by playing several notes at a time. However, playing several lead melodies at the same time on a single instrument can be quite tricky and usually these harmonies are later added during overdubs in a studio session.

For two-part harmonies, there seem to be intervals that are more common than others and we will discuss how these different intervals sound like. Typical intervals are minor thirds, major thirds, perfect fourths and perfect fifths.

To find out more about harmonizing lead guitar melodies, you can watch the video above or on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/j_7yhdzwAAE).
