_Leslie Vocals on YouTube._
{: .text-center .text-muted}

Hi, welcome to an episode of "Thinking Inside the Box" on Noah's Ark. In the video, we're going to talk about how to recreate an effect I call "Leslie Vocals". The effect can be prominently heard on the Black Sabbath track "Planet Caravan" from their 1970 debut album Paranoid.

In previous videos, we've explored how we can apply the Leslie speaker cabinet with various sound sources such as the guitar and even the piano. This time I'd like to focus on the vocals.

The Leslie speaker works quite well on the vocals adding this exaggerated vibrato to the vocals and a sensation of listening underwater. However, it is very easy to overdo this effect and render the vocals unintelligible.

To find out more about the leslie vocal effect, you can watch the video above or on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/WY1xs6f-2Bs).
