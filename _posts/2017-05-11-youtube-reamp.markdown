_Reamping on YouTube._

Hi, welcome to an episode of "Thinking Outside the Box" on Noah's Ark. In the video, we're going to talk about Reamping with guitar pedals. The Reamp box was first invented by John Cuniberti and allowed artists such as Steely Dan to perfect guitar recordings in the studio and alleviate the process by allowing complete seperation between performance and sound quality.

As a converse process to recording signals using a DI box, also called direct injection where instrument level signals are lowered to microphone level and higher impedence is lowered, Reamping converts line level signals to instrument levels and matches the impedence.

Using the two boxes in conjonction, we can create a setup that allows us to use guitar pedals with virtually any type of signal from the DAW. The way we wire the loop is by using the Reamp box to convert the line level signal to instrument level, allowing the use of the guitar pedals in chain, then the output of the effects chain can be brought back to mic level using the DI box and raised to line level with the interface preamps.

To find out more about reamping with guitar pedals, you can watch the video above or on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/BdlYw_hxCgE).
