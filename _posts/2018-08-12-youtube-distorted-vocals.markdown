_Distorted Vocals on YouTube._
{: .text-center .text-muted}

Hi, welcome to an episode of “Thinking Inside the Box” on Noah’s Ark. In the video, we're gonna talk about how to recreate the distorted vocal effect in the box.

There are several ways to go about this. We can either reamp a vocal signal through a real guitar amp and record that with a microphone. Or we can apply a distortion plugin to the vocals such as the SansAmp PSA-1 in the DAW.

If you want to experiment with reamping but are unsure how to do this, I've made a video previously that you can check out that explains the process in detail.

To find out more about the distorted vocal effect, you can watch the video above or on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/lj79JK0xw_s).
