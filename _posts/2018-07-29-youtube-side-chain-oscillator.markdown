_Side Chain Oscillator on YouTube._
{: .text-center .text-muted}

Hi, welcome to an episode of “Thinking Inside the Box” on Noah’s Ark. In the video, we're gonna talk about different uses of an oscillator as a musical tool in your productions.

Typically one tends to see an oscillator as a mere test tool unless in the context of a sound-generating module of a synthesiser. An oscillator is often used as a calibration tool especially in the analog world where equipment had to be properly aligned and calibrated before use.

However, an oscillator can potentially have musical applications when used in a different light and in a subtle way in the background.

An oscillator can be set to generate different types of waveforms such as sine, triangle, square, sawtooth, white noise and pink noise.

Today, I'd like to use a sine wave and pink noise generator along with the side chain capabilities of an expander/gate to enhance drums in two different contexts.

The first application consists in using a sine wave tuned to the key of the song with a noise gate triggered by the bass drum signal to produce lower harmonics and fatten up the kick.

The second application consists in using pink noise with a noise gate triggered by the snare drum signal to emphasise the sound of snares from the drum acting almost as a bottom mic.

To find out more about oscillator mixing tricks, you can watch the video above or on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/asuEnvjz8Q8).
