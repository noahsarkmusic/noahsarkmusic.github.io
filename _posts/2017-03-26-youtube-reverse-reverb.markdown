_Pink Floyd's Reverse Reverb on YouTube._
{: .text-center .text-muted}

Hi, welcome to an episode of "Thinking Inside the Box" on Noah's Ark. In the video, we're going to talk about reverse reverb or backwards reverb, an effect often associated with psychedelic rock from the 60s. This effect can be heard on countless tracks by Pink Floyd but most notably on the albums Animals and Wish You Were Here. The effect is usually applied on drums or percussive sources but it can be used on other instruments.

Let's start with some historical background. It is said that reverse reverb was first invented by Jimmy Page along with Glyn Johns on an early Led Zeppelin session. The way Page used to create this effect was by using the limitations of tape and finding ways to think outside the box.

So how do you create this effect with tape? First, you need to flip the tape of the desired track and play it in reverse. Second, send and return a reverb signal of your choice from the flipped track and record the output on another track. Lastly, flip both the original track back as well as the reverb track which consequently ends up reversed and before the original signal. And there you go, you have created the reverse reverb effect on tape but it ends up being quite a hassle to obtain this result with tape.

Fortunately, it is much easier to produce this effect in the DAW. For this, we're only going to use one single AudioSuite plugin included with Pro Tools called Reverse.
