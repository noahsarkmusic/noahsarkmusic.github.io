_Effects Without Plugins on YouTube._
{: .text-center .text-muted}

Hi, welcome to an episode of “Thinking Inside the Box” on Noah’s Ark. In the video, we're gonna talk about different effects that require no plugins but only the basic functionalities of a DAW.

Plugins can be very useful and handy to use most of the time, but did you know that some of the functionalities can be replicated easily without any plugins?

Let's start with a common mixing process that is often performed using plugins. As seen in a previous video about M/S, stereo widening can be achieved without any plugins, simply by using the bus properties of a DAW such as sends and auxes.

To set up the routing for stereo widening in your DAW, you first need to create an aux for the Mid channel and two auxes for the Side channels. Then by simply balancing the amount of side signal versus mid signal in the stereo signal, we can alter the stereo image of the source.

Another effect we can easily achieve in a DAW is phasing. Simply duplicate a track and shift the signal by a couple of milliseconds. Depending on the amount of delay time, you can achieve different phasing sounds but it can be useful to convert a mono signal into a stereo source as seen in a previous video.

Following on the previous effect if the duplicated track is shifted even more using a much longer delay time, we can achieve a single delay line. If duplicated even more and with lower amounts of levels every subsequent repeat, we can almost simulate a traditional tape delay with feedback.

To find out more about effects without plugins, you can watch the video above or on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/HogbAjvNMsE).
