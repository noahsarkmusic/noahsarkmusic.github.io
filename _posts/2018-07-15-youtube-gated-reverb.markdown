_Gated Reverb on YouTube._
{: .text-center .text-muted}

Hi, welcome to an episode of “Thinking Inside the Box” on Noah’s Ark. In the video, we're gonna talk about how to recreate the gated reverb effect. This effect was notoriously made famous on Phil Collins' song In the Air Tonight but gated reverbs were heard on virtually every hit record in the 80s.

So how does gated reverb work? The process is pretty simple. Let's say that we want to apply this effect on a snare drum of a drum track. We first send the snare drum signal to an aux using a send and apply a reverb of our choice on this parallel track. Then we simply apply a gate after the reverb signal in order to choke the reverb tail and only keep the early reflections.

To accentuate the effect, a big bright reverb can be used with a pretty sharp gate, set at the appropriate threshold. By adjusting the release time and the threshold and keeping the range at the maximum, we can get the desired sound.

To find out more about the gated reverb effect, you can watch the video above or on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/vSfeFX92Ppw).
