I’ve spent a lot of time looking for the original pressing of this record. A rare gatefold that has been re-issued a number of times. Not even sure if the one I own is in fact an original but I finally got a hold of it in Japan. I’ll tell you, if you can’t find a rare vinyl you’re desperately searching for, fly to Japan. I can guarantee they have every single type of pressing you’ve ever imagined of.

If the name of this record doesn’t ring a bell to you, I’m sure the name of Fleetwood Mac has come across. This was the debut for both Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, who are now part of Fleetwood Mac thanks to this album recorded in 1973 at Sound City. Drummer of Fleetwood Mac, Mick Fleetwood would hear the guitar solo on “Frozen Love”, later on inviting both to join his band.

What would follow this event is now history, although some might argue it being a commercial success. They would release together the eponymous album _Fleetwood Mac_ in 1975 and _Rumours_ in 1977, propelling them to worldwide fame.

The important aspect to retain here is Buckingham’s precocious songwriting skills and guitar chops. Even though the record didn’t sell and is relatively little-known, it was sufficient to impress Fleetwood’s ears. Known for his fingerpicking style just like Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits, Buckingham used alternate tunings to create beautiful instrumental songs such as “Stephanie”, named after girlfriend and partner at the time, Stevie Nicks.

Let’s not forget Nicks, who also became successful in her solo career, and even wrote one of Fleetwood Mac’s hit songs, “Crystal” that stems down from the original version recorded on _Buckingham Nicks_.

Better yet, the record is only available in LP format, and that is an honor. Being one of the first albums recorded on the analog Neve console at Sound City, it will forever preserve that priceless grit of tape wherever and whenever played back.

Do yourself a favor and take a careful listen to _Buckingham Nicks_ on vinyl. Even if it’s a needle in a haystack to obtain this relic, it’s totally worth it.
