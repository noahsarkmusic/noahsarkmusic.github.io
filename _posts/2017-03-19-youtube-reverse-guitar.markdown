_Jimi Hendrix's Reverse Guitar on YouTube._
{: .text-center .text-muted}

Hi, welcome to an episode of "Thinking Inside the Box" on Noah's Ark. In the video, we're going to talk about reverse guitar or backwards guitar, an effect often associated with psychedelic rock from the 60s. The use of this effect can be famously heard on Jimi Hendrix's 1967 song "Castles Made of Sand" engineered and recorded by Eddie Kramer at Olympic Studios in London.

Recreating the effect on a DAW is really straightforward and only makes use of one AudioSuite plugin that comes with the software: Reverse. Just select the track and apply the effect to your desired instrument.

To find out more about Jimi Hendrix's reverse guitar sound, you can watch the video above or on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/shdew1kILdU).
