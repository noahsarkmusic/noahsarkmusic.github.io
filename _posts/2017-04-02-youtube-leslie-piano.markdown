_Pink Floyd's Leslie Piano on YouTube._
{: .text-center .text-muted}

Hi, welcome to an episode of "Thinking Inside the Box" on Noah's Ark. In the video, we're going to talk about how to recreate an effect I call "Leslie Piano". This unusual effect I first discovered on a Pink Floyd record called "Echoes", a 23-minute long opus on the B side of the 1971 album Meddle.

Let's start with some historical background. Pink Floyd were known by then for their ingeneous sound effects in the studio and like many accidents and experiments, they discovered new sounds that could be incorporated into their compositions. Another well-known sound effect that could be heard on the track is the seagull sound that was achieved by accident when David Gilmour plugged his wah-wah pedal in reverse.

As a matter of fact, the first high-pitched note you hear on the track is what I call the leslie piano sound we are going to discuss. You can definitely guess that there is some kind of piano component in that sound but it is hard to define what instrument this is. So how was this achieved at Abbey Road Studios?

Well, what they did is that they sent the miked up piano sound of Rick Wright into a Leslie rotating speaker to amplify the piano and add that swirling wobbly sound to it and the result is magnificent. Recreating the sound in the box is quite straightforward.

To find out more about Pink Floyd's leslie piano sound, you can watch the video above or on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/zfEGKzjfgk0).
