_Led Zeppelin's Phased and Delayed Drums on YouTube._
{: .text-center .text-muted}

Hi, welcome to an episode of Thinking Inside the Box on Noah's Ark. In the video, we'll explore the drum sounds of John Bonham, drummer of Led Zeppelin. In particular, we'll focus on two different effects notably heard on When the Levee Breaks from Zeppelin's fourth Untitled album and Kashmir from the double album Physical Graffitti.

Although we could talk for ages on how to get as close as possible to a Bonham drum sound by analysing the equipment such as his Ludwig drums and Paiste cymbals as well as the Beyerdynamic M160 ribbon microphones placed in the staircase at Headley Grange, ultimately you need a good drummer because so much of the sound of certain instruments lies in the hands or fingers of those particular players.

So this video will instead focus on the effects applied to Bonham's drums, namely the Eventide PS101 phaser and the Binson Echorec tape delay. Andy Johns, the sound engineer for most Led Zeppelin albums and also brother of famous engineer Glyn Johns was constantly trying to innovate the drum sound to impress John Bonham and he came up with the phasing sound on Kashmir and the delayed sound on When the Levee Breaks.

To find out more about Led Zeppelin's phased and delayed drum sound, you can watch the video above or on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/zDZqcOvt4gs).
