The tale of Gizzy Limelight is the story of an antihero that strives to become a rock icon but eventually fails due to his inability to stay true to himself. His conviction to metamorphose manifests in delusion and drug usage that will eventually consume him to death as he struggles to battle against his shadow. As Gizzy's life unfolds, he hardly steps into the limelight, lonesome and stranded in his own mind's creations.

The concept album builds around the themes of identity, stardom, depression and love.
