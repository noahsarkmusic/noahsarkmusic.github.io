Noah's Ark is a solo project led by Noah himself. His efforts concentrate on the reunification of the animals of the ark in order to protect the endangered specie of classic rock through this apocalyptic era of music. He spends the majority of his time playing instruments to prepare for the musical awakening yet to come. Amongst the animals that have already joined him are the ox, three different pigs, diamond dogs, a swan and some wild horses.

Noah is also a music producer, sound engineer and multi-instrumentalist, currently studying at the Abbey Road Institute in London, United Kingdom. He is the sole contributor on this project and both albums have been recorded in his man cave in Montreal, Canada. In the past, he has received multiple honors including the best drummer award at the Emergenza competition in Paris, France and a scholarship as a drummer for Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts.
