The story is set at an age when music has become intergalactic. Each planet in the Solar system has a defined musical genre. As radio stations across planets resonate and pirate spaceships broadcast illegal streaming signals, Earth music loses its identity and popularity against music from other planets. This love and hate manifesto about technology is presented through the eyes of one earthling identified by his numerical name of 10 (read "Two"). The character seeks comfort in his thoughts as he is forced by the authorities to leave Earth and crammed in a rocket. As 10 recollects life events, he speculates that his memories have been altered upon listening to the Rocket Radio.

The concept album builds around the themes of science-fiction, isolation, authority and technology.
